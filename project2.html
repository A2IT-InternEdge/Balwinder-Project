    <h1>My Favorite Recipe</h1>
    <p>I have seen many ads of Maggie and from that I too decided to make it by my own. I bought some packets of Maggie and then tried to make it just like what it shows. I thought it would be 2 minutes cooking but it took me half an hour to make. When I made it for the first time, I have used extra water so it became water logged and was not looking good, so I decided to make it again. This time I followed the instructions carefully and now I have got the spicy, tasty Maggie ready. I served it to my family and they all said I have. made it awesome. I was feeling very happy and I was thinking I can be a very good cook.</p>
